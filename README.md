## a Pinterest Clone

### Overview
a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <https://midnight-dust.glitch.me> and deploy it to c9.

### User Story
-  As an unauthenticated user, I can login.
-  As an authenticated user, I can link to images.
-  As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.
-  As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.
-  As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.
-  As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)
-  Hint: [Masonry.js](http://masonry.desandro.com/) is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.
